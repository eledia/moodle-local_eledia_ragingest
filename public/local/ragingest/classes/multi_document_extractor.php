/**
 * Optional interface for extractors that emit several documents per module.
 *
 * Most activities map to a single document (the {@see content_extractor}
 * contract). Some — a Folder with several files, or potentially a Book split
 * per chapter — are better represented as multiple documents so that, for
 * example, each PDF keeps its native `application/pdf` content type and is
 * parsed independently by the RAG service.
 *
 * Each returned document is sent as its own sub-document
 * ({@see source_id_helper::build_sub()}); the ingestion manager clears the
 * module's previous document set with a prefix-scoped delete before sending the
 * current one, so added/removed/renamed files never leave orphaned vectors.
 *
 * An extractor implementing this interface must also implement
 * {@see content_extractor}; the manager prefers the multi-document method when
 * present and falls back to {@see content_extractor::extract()} otherwise.
